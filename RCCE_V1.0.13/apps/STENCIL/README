This directory contains sources for two executables:
1. RCCE_stencil.c uses the "gory" interface and (partly) unsynchronized
   communications. Build it with:
   make API=gory stencil
2. RCVCE_stencil_synch uses the basic interface and fully synchronized
   communications. Build it with:
   make stencil_synch
